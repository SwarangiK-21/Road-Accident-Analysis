# Road-Accident-Analysis
The project involves creating an interactive Excel dashboard to address a business problem related to road accidents in 2021 and 2022. The dynamic dashboard allows users to filter data by rural/urban categories and accident dates using slicers. Demo data from Kaggle is used for practice, not real-time analysis.
